Day - 5:
--------
- PropTypes
- state vs props
- presentational vs container components
- component communication
- events
- lifecycle events

PropTypes:
----------
PropTypes.array
PropTypes.bool
PropTypes.func
PropTypes.number
PropTypes.string
PropTypes.object
PropTypes.symbol

- to accept one of two types
  PropTypes.oneOfType([
	PropTypes.string, PropTypes.number
  ])
- to accept one of many values
  PropTypes.oneOf(['test1', 'test2', 'test3'])  
  
- to check or accept instance of class
  PropTypes.instanceOf(anyojbect)
- to accept any type
  PropTypes.any  
- to check array of data type 
  PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.number)

State vs Props:
---------------
- state is initialized and managed by component
  but props are  passed to child component
  by its parent component
  
- props can be used in functional and class component
  but state can be used only in class component
  
- props are read-only props that means child 
  component can never change props value
  
- presentational components are concerned with
  look and container components are concerned with
  making things work.

- presentational components get data through 
  it's props, container component can have
  state and business logic
- product-list, it is container component 
- product, as presentational component  

Event:
------
- all events in react are camelCased
- the methods of es6 classes by default are not
  bound

- Keyboard:
  onKeyDown
  onKeyUp
  onKeyPress  
  
- onFocus
- onBlur
- onChange
- onSubmit

- onClick
- onDoubleClick

Lifecycle events:
-----------------
- 3 phases in react component life cycle
  1. Mounting
  2. Updating
  3. Unmounting

1. Mounting:
------------
constructor(): to set up our initial state
getDerivedStateFromProps():
render()
componentDidMount()
